MRV MARC Record Viewer

The original Record viewer by Thomas Meehan was forked to add features and strip unnecessary data.

Intent: 

Output ISBN, BOOK TITLE, and, Author to CSV

After breaking down the outputs, I found the necessary MARC input fields to be [020, 100, 245]


Changes:

Inputs: You can now process files rather rather than the original text field (.mrc / .txt) 

Output: The Submit button displays the processed ISBN, Book Title, and Author. The Export button outputs the ISBN, Book Title, and Authors into a single CSV File.
